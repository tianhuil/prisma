## FAQ

Yes, Prisma 1 will continue to be maintained. However, most Prisma engineering resources will go into the development of [Prisma 2](https://github.com/prisma/prisma2) (i.e. [Photon](https://photonjs.prisma.io/) and [Lift](https://lift.prisma.io/)). 

There will be no new features developed for Prisma 1.
