## Overview

The Prisma client is generated from your [datamodel](knul). Its API exposes CRUD and other operations for the models defined in the datamodel.

For this page, we'll assume your Prisma project is based on the following datamodel:

```graphql
type Post {
  id: ID! @unique
  createdAt: DateTime!
  updatedAt: DateTime!
  title: String!
  published: Boolean! @default(value: "false")
  author: User
  comments: [Comment!]!
}

type User {
  id: ID! @unique
  name: String
  email: String! @unique
  role: Role! @default(value: "USER")
  posts: [Post!]!
  comments: [Comment!]!
}

type Comment {
  id: ID! @unique
  createdAt: DateTime!
  text: String!
  post: Post!
  writtenBy: User!
}

enum Role {
  USER
  ADMIN
}
```

<Warning>

The syntax of this datamodel is based on the datamodel v1. If you're using the [MongoDB connector](jgfm), you're already using the next version of the [datamodel v1.1](b6a7) which looks a bit different (learn more [here](knun)). The generated API operations will be the same with a few exceptions that are highlighted on this page.

</Warning>

For each model type in your datamodel, six methods for writing data are generated. For example, for the `User` model the following operations are available:

- `CreateUser`: Creates a new `User` record in the database 
- `UpdateUser`: Updates an existing `User` record in the database
- `DeleteUser`: Deletes an existing `User` record from the database
- `UpsertUser`: Updates an existing or create a new `User` record in the database
- `UpdateManyUsers`: Updates many existing `User` records in the database at once. 
- `DeleteManyUsers`: Deletes many existing `User` records from the database at once.

## Creating records

When creating new records in the database, the `Create`-method takes one input object which wraps all the scalar fields of the record to be created. It also provides a way to create relational data for the model, this can be supplied using [nested object writes](#nested-object-writes).

Each method call returns an object that contains all the scalar fields of the model that was just created.


### Examples

_Create a new user_:

<Code languages={["Go", "Result"]}>

```go
email := "alice@prisma.io"
name := "Alice"
user, err := client.CreateUser(prisma.UserCreateInput{
  Email: email,
  Name:  &name,
}).Exec(ctx)
```

```go
&prisma.User{
	ID:"cjsyyj97x003m0982pvpn0ci0", 
	Name:(*string)(0xc000126140), // Alice
	Email:"alice@prisma.io"
}
```

</Code>

_Create a new post and set `alice@prisma.io` as the author_:

> When using the **MySQL** or **Postgres** databases connectors, the following call is executed as a single database transaction. The **MongoDB** connector [doesn't support transactions yet](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/3785). Learn more in the [Declarative nest writes](#declarative-nested-writes) section.

<Code languages={["Go", "Result"]}>

```go
email := "alice@prisma.io"
title := "Join us for GraphQL Conf in 2019"
post, err := client.CreatePost(prisma.PostCreateInput{
  Title: title,
  Author: &prisma.UserCreateOneWithoutPostsInput{
    Connect: &prisma.UserWhereUniqueInput{
      Email: &email,
    },
  },
}).Exec(ctx)
```

```go
&prisma.Post{
	ID:"cjsyyoyjk003s0982o6e2abxn", 
	CreatedAt:"2019-03-07T18:25:44.672Z", 
	UpdatedAt:"2019-03-07T18:25:44.672Z", 
	Title:"Join us for GraphQL Conf in 2019", 
	Published:false
}
```

</Code>

_Create a new user with two new posts_:

> When using the **MySQL** or **Postgres** databases connectors, the following call is executed as a single database transaction. The **MongoDB** connector [doesn't support transactions yet](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/3785).

<Code languages={["Go", "Result"]}>

```go
name := "Bob"
email := "bob@prisma.io"
title1 := "Follow @prisma on Twitter"
title2 := "Join us for GraphQL Conf"
user, err := client.CreateUser(prisma.UserCreateInput{
	Email: email,
	Name:  &name,
	Posts: &prisma.PostCreateManyWithoutAuthorInput{
		Create: []prisma.PostCreateWithoutAuthorInput{
			prisma.PostCreateWithoutAuthorInput{
				Title: title1,
			},
			prisma.PostCreateWithoutAuthorInput{
				Title: title2,
			},
		},
	},
}).Exec(ctx)
```

```go
&prisma.User{
  ID:"cjsyytzn0004d0982gbyeqep7", 
  Name:(*string)(0xc000010140), // "Bob" 
  Email:"bob@prisma.io"
}
```

</Code>

## Updating records

When updating existing records in the database, the `Update`-method receives one input object with two fields:

- `Data`: This is similar to the input object you provide to a `Create`-method. It wraps scalar fields of the model to be updated and lets you provide relational data via [nested object writes](#nested-object-writes).
- `Where`: This is used to select the record that should be updated. You can use any [unique](knul#unique-scalar-fields) field to identify the record. For the example datamodel above, this means that for `User`, `Post` and `Comment` it has an `id` property. For `User` it additionally accepts the `email` field.

Each method call returns an object that contains all the scalar fields of the model that was just updated.

### Examples

_Update the role of an existing user_:

<Code languages={["Go", "Result"]}>

```go
id := "cjsyytzn0004d0982gbyeqep7"
role := prisma.RoleAdmin
user, err := client.UpdateUser(prisma.UserUpdateParams{
  Where: prisma.UserWhereUniqueInput{
    ID: &id,
  },
  Data: prisma.UserUpdateInput{
    Role: &role,
  },
}).Exec(ctx)
```

```go
&prisma.User{
  ID:"cjsyysx3s004009829vh893vq", 
  Name:(*string)(0xc000010140), // "Bob" 
  Email:"bob@prisma.io"
}
```

</Code>

_Update the author of a post_:

<Code languages={["Go", "Result"]}>

```go
id := "cjsx2j8bw02920b25rl806l07"
email := "bob@prisma.io"
post, err := client.UpdatePost(prisma.PostUpdateParams{
	Where: prisma.PostWhereUniqueInput{
		ID: &id,
	},
	Data: prisma.PostUpdateInput{
		Author: &prisma.UserUpdateOneWithoutPostsInput{
			Connect: &prisma.UserWhereUniqueInput{
				Email: &email,
			},
		},
	},
}).Exec(ctx)
```

```go
&prisma.Post{
	ID:"cjsx2j8bw02920b25rl806l07", 
	CreatedAt:"2019-03-07T18:25:44.672Z", 
	UpdatedAt:"2019-03-07T18:25:44.672Z", 
	Title:"Join us for GraphQL Conf in 2019", 
	Published:false
}
```

</Code>

## Deleting records

When deleting records from the database, the `Delete`-method receives one input object that specifies which record is to be deleted. The type of this input object is similar to the `Where` object in `Update`-methods.

The properties of that object correspond to those fields of the model that are marked as [unique](knul#unique-scalar-fields). For the example datamodel above, this means that for `User`, `Post` and `Comment` it has an `id` property. For `User` it additionally accepts the `email` field.

Each method call returns an object that contains all the scalar fields of the model that was just deleted.

### Examples

_Delete a post by its id_:

<Code languages={["Go", "Result"]}>

```go
id := "cjsyqxwqo000j0982da8cvw7o"
post, err := client.DeletePost(prisma.PostWhereUniqueInput{
	ID: &id,
}).Exec(ctx)
```

```go
&prisma.Post{
  ID:"cjsyqxwqo000j0982da8cvw7o", 
  CreatedAt:"2019-03-07T14:48:45.280Z", 
  UpdatedAt:"2019-03-07T14:48:45.280Z", 
  Title:"Introducing the Analytical Engine", 
  Published:false
}
```

</Code>

_Delete a user by their email_:

<Code languages={["Go", "Result"]}>

```go
email := "bob@prisma.io"
user, err := client.DeleteUser(prisma.UserWhereUniqueInput{
  Email: &email,
}).Exec(ctx)
```

```go
&prisma.User{
  ID:"cjsyytzn0004d0982gbyeqep7", 
  Name:(*string)(0xc0001361e0), // "Bob" 
  Email:"bob@prisma.io"
}
```

</Code>


## Creating or updating objects (upserts)

Upsert operations allow you to _try_ to update an existing record. If that record actually does not exist yet, it will be created. The `Upsert`-methods are a mix of `Create`- and `Update`-methods, meaning they receive an input argument that has three fields:

- `Where`: Identical to the `Where` field provided in `Update`-methods
- `Update`: Identical to the `Data` field provided in `Update`-methods
- `Create`: Identical to the input object provided in `Create`-methods

### Examples

_Update the role of a user. If the user doesn't exist yet, create a new one_:

<Code languages={["Go", "Result"]}>

```go
name := "Alice"
role := prisma.RoleAdmin
email := "alice@prisma.io"
user, err := client.UpsertUser(prisma.UserUpsertParams{
	Where: prisma.UserWhereUniqueInput{
		Email: &email,
	},
	Update: prisma.UserUpdateInput{
		Role: &role,
	},
	Create: prisma.UserCreateInput{
		Email: email,
		Role:  &role,
		Name:  &name,
	},
}).Exec(ctx)
```

```go
&prisma.User{
  ID:"cjsyyj97x003m0982pvpn0ci0", 
  Name:(*string)(0xc00016e120), // "Alice" 
  Email:"alice@prisma.io"
}
```

</Code>


## Updating and deleting many records in bulk

The Prisma client API offers special methods to update or delete many records at once. Each `UpdateMany`- and `DeleteMany`-method returns the _number_ of records that ultimately have been affected by the operation.

### Examples

_Unpublish three posts by their IDs_:

<Code languages={["Go", "Result"]}>

```go
ids := []string{"cjsyqxwqv000l0982p5qdq34p", "cjsyqxwqo000j0982da8cvw7o", "cjsyqxwr0000n0982cke8i5sc"}
published := true
updatedPostsCount, err := client.UpdateManyPosts(prisma.PostUpdateManyParams{
  Where: &prisma.PostWhereInput{
    IDIn: ids,
  },
  Data: prisma.PostUpdateManyMutationInput{
    Published: &published,
  },
}).Exec(ctx)
```

```go
prisma.BatchPayload{Count:2}
```

</Code>

<Warning>

If one of more of the provided IDs does not actually exist in the database, the operation will **not** return an error. The returned `count` indicates how many records actually were updated.

</Warning>

_Update all posts where the description contains the string `prisma` and publish them_:

<Code languages={["Go", "Result"]}>

```go
filter := "prisma"
published := true
updatedPostsCount, err := client.UpdateManyPosts(prisma.PostUpdateManyParams{
  Where: &prisma.PostWhereInput{
    TitleContains: &filter,
  },
  Data: prisma.PostUpdateManyMutationInput{
    Published: &published,
  },
}).Exec(ctx)
```

```go
prisma.BatchPayload{Count:1}
```

</Code>


_Delete all posts that were created before 2018_:

<Code languages={["Go", "Result"]}>

```go
christmas := "2019-12-24"
deletePostsCount, err := client.DeleteManyPosts(&prisma.PostWhereInput{
  CreatedAtGt: &christmas,
}).Exec(ctx)
```

```go
42
```

</Code>

## Nested object writes

Nested object writes let you modify multiple database records across relations in a single transaction. Nested object writes are available for `Create`- and `Update`-methods.

<Warning>

The [MongoDB](jgfm) database connector currently does not support ACID transactions. Learn more in [this](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/3738) GitHub issue.

</Warning>

Because the model `User` has a relation to `Post` via the `author` field, you can create/update/delete `Post` records through `CreateUser` and `UpdateUser` operations. In these cases, the `Author` field in the `Data` object for `CreateUser` and `UpdateUser` operations can contain one or more of the following keywords: 

- `Create`: Creates a new `Post` record and connects it via the `author` field to the `User` record.
- `Update`: Updates a `Post` record that is connected to a `User` record via the `author` field.
- `Upsert`: Updates a `Post` record that is connected to a `User` record via the `author` field or creates a new `Post` record and connects it via the `author` field to the `User` record.
- `Delete`: Deletes a `Post` record that is connected to a `User` record via the `author` field.
- `Connect`: Connects a `Post` record to a `User` record via the `author` field.
- `Disconnect`: Disconnects a `Post` record from a `User` record.
- `Set`:  Connects a `Post` record to a `User` record via the `author` field. If the `Post` record was connected to a different `User` record before, it is disconnected from that one (`Set` effecitvely executes `connect` and `disconnect` operations under the hood).

<Code languages={["Go", "Result"]}>

```go
id := "cjsyqxwqo000j0982da8cvw7o"
name := "Bob"
email := "bob@prisma.io"
title1 := "Follow @prisma on Twitter"
title2 := "Join us for GraphQL Conf"
user, err := client.CreateUser(prisma.UserCreateInput{
  Email: email,
  Name:  &name,
  Posts: &prisma.PostCreateManyWithoutAuthorInput{
    Create: []prisma.PostCreateWithoutAuthorInput{
      prisma.PostCreateWithoutAuthorInput{
        Title: title1,
      },
      prisma.PostCreateWithoutAuthorInput{
        Title: title2,
      },
    },
    Connect: []prisma.PostWhereUniqueInput{
      prisma.PostWhereUniqueInput{
        ID: &id,
      },
    },
  },
}).Exec(ctx)
```

```go
&prisma.User{
  ID:"cjsyytzn0004d0982gbyeqep7", 
  Name:(*string)(0xc000010140), // "Bob" 
  Email:"bob@prisma.io"
}
```
