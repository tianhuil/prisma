## FAQ

We're constantly trying to improve the tools that we build. A key component that helps us achieve better quality in our tools is **usage tracking**.

Usage tracking refers to the collection of anonymized user data ("usage meta data") that provides insights into how our tools are being used, and what problems our users run into.

## What usage metrics are being tracked?

We're currently tracking usage meta data for the following components:

### Prisma CLI

- **Metrics/Events**: Every command executed with the Prisma CLI emits an event to our metrics collector. The event contains information about command that was executed and the CLI version.
- **Services**: The CLI uses [Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/) for crash reporting.

### Prisma server

- **Metrics/Events**: The Prisma server sends an hourly ping to our metrics collector. The request contains: Date and time, server ID, number of running services, Prisma server info (version, IP, creation date).
- **Services**: The Prisma server doesn't use any services for usage tracking.

### Prisma Admin

- **Metrics/Events**: Prisma Admin doesn't send any events. It only tracks the number of users, sessions and bounce rate.
- **Services**: Prisma Admin uses [Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/) for crash reporting and [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/) for the remaining metrics.

## How to opt-out of usage tracking?

It is currently not possible to disable usage tracking. However, we are working on this and it will soon be able to opt-out.
