## Goals

On this page, you will learn how to:

- Adjust the datamodel and update your Prisma API
- Regenerate your Prisma client
- Create two database records in a single transaction
- Query relational data

<Warning>

This page is only relevant if you started with a [new database](j002) or a [Demo server](j001). If you configured Prisma with an [existing database](j003), you need to run migrations directly against your database.

</Warning>


## Adjust your datamodel

Update the datamodel in `datamodel.prisma` as follows:

```graphql copy
type User {
  id: ID! @id
  email: String @unique
  name: String!
  posts: [Post!]!
}

type Post {
  id: ID! @id
  title: String!
  published: Boolean! @default(value: false)
  author: User @relation(link: INLINE)
}
```

Here's what changed:

- You added a new `email` field to the `User` type.
- You added a new `Post` type to the datamodel.
- You added a _relation_ between `User` and `Post` (via the `posts` and `author` fields).

## Redeploy your Prisma API

To apply the changes you just made to your datamodel, you need to redeploy the Prisma datamodel:

```bash copy
prisma deploy
```

## Regenerate your Prisma client

Because the Prisma client is based on your datamodel, it needs to be regenerated every time the datamodel is updated:

```bash copy
prisma generate
```

The Prisma client library in the `/generated/prisma-client` directory is now being updated and its API has been adjusted to use the new datamodel.

<Info>

You can ensure that your Prisma client is automatically being updated after every deploy by adding the following lines to your `prisma.yml`:

```yml copy
hooks:
  post-deploy:
    - prisma generate
```

</Info>

## Read and write nested objects

The Prisma client API allows to write nested objects in a single transaction without having to manually control when the transaction starts or ends.

<Warning>

The [MongoDB](jgfm) database connector currently does not support ACID transactions. Learn more in [this](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/3738) GitHub issue.

</Warning>

Update your `index.js` to look as follows:

```js copy
const { prisma } = require('./generated/prisma-client')

// A `main` function so that we can use async/await
async function main() {

  // Create a new user with a new post
  const newUser = await prisma
    .createUser({
      name: "Bob",
      email: "bob@prisma.io",
      posts: {
        create: [{
          title: "Join us for GraphQL Conf in 2019",
        }, {
          title: "Subscribe to GraphQL Weekly for GraphQL news",
        }]
      },
    })
  console.log(`Created new user: ${newUser.name} (ID: ${newUser.id})`)

  // Read all users from the database and print them to the console
  const allUsers = await prisma.users()
  console.log(allUsers)

  const allPosts = await prisma.posts()
  console.log(allPosts)
}

main().catch(e => console.error(e))
```

Run the script with the following command:

```bash copy
node index.js
```

## Query relational data

With the Prisma client API, you can navigate relations in your data graph using chained method calls (also called _fluent API_). Here is how you can query the `posts` written by a certain `User`:

```js copy
const { prisma } = require('./generated/prisma-client')

// A `main` function so that we can use async/await
async function main() {

  // Read the previously created user from the database and print their posts to the console
  const postsByUser = await prisma
    .user({ email: "bob@prisma.io" })
    .posts()
  console.log(`All posts by that user: ${JSON.stringify(postsByUser)}`)

}

main().catch(e => console.error(e))
```
