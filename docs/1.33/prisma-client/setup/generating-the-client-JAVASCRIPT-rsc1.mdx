## Overview

The Prisma client is auto-generated using the `prisma generate` command of the [Prisma CLI](alx4). One Prisma client connects to exactly one Prisma service.

`prisma generate` reads the information that's specified under the [`generate`](5cy7#generate-optional) root property in your service's `prisma.yml`. 

## Configuring `generate` in `prisma.yml`

The `generate` root property accepts a list of _objects_. Each object has two fields:

- `generator`: The programming language in which the Prisma client should be generated. Here are the accepted values:
  -  `typescript-client`
  -  `javascript-client`
  -  `flow-client`
  -  `go-client`
- `output`: The path and name of the file in which the Prisma client should be stored.

### Example

As an example, consider the following `prisma.yml`:

```yml
datamodel: datamodel.prisma
endpoint: http://localhost:4466
secret: mysecret42

generate:
  - generator: javascript-client
    output: ./prisma-client/
```

Running [`prisma generate`](xcv2) in the directory where that `prisma.yml` is located generates a Prisma client in JavaScript and stores the generated files in a directory called `prisma-client`.

The generated Prisma client is configured to target the `endpoint` specified in `prisma.yml`. It also knows the `secret` so that it can authenticate against your Prisma service when you're using it in your application.

### Using environment variables in `prisma.yml`

Note that you can also reference environment variables in `prisma.yml` by using the `env:`-prefix and enclosing them with `${}`. For example, if you have an environment variable set that's called `MY_SECRET`:

```yml
datamodel: datamodel.prisma
endpoint: http://localhost:4466
secret: ${env:MY_SECRET}

generate:
  - generator: javascript-client
    output: ./prisma-client/
```

You can find more info about using environment variables [here](5cy7#using-variables).

## Generated files

Here is an overview of the files that are generated for the JavaScript client:

- `index.d.ts`: Type definitions for the Prisma client (in TypeScript). The type definitions include representations of your models (from the [datamodel](knul)) as well as the function signatures for the generated API operations of the Prisma client. Even though it's TypeScript, this file is included in the JavaScript Prisma client to enable auto-completion and other features in your code editor.
- `index.js`: The Prisma client.
- `prisma-schema.js`: This file is used by the Prisma client under the hood.
