## Overview

Prisma client is currently in [Preview](oje2#preview-vs-final). This means its API is considered stable but there might be significant internal improvements while it's still in Preview. You can find the docs for it [here](/prisma-client).

You can find the RFC for the next version of the Prisma client API [here](https://github.com/prisma/rfcs/blob/new-ts-client-rfc/text/0000-new-ts-client.md).
