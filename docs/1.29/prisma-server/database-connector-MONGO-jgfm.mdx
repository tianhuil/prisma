## Overview

<Warning>

The [MongoDB](jgfm) database connector currently does not support ACID transactions. Learn more in [this](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/3738) GitHub issue.

</Warning>

A database connector is the bridge between Prisma and the underlying database. The MongoDB connector is used to connect a Prisma server to a [MonogDB](https://www.mongodb.com) database. 

The core responsibilities of a database connector are:

- Translate requests from the Prisma client into MongoDB API calls
- Execute the generated API call against the database
- Return the result from the database back to the Prisma client 

When configuring your Prisma server with Docker, you need to specify which connector you'd like to use in order to connect to a certain database. You provide this info via the `connector` property:

<Code lines="6">

```yml
PRISMA_CONFIG: |
  managementApiSecret: __YOUR_MANAGEMENT_API_SECRET__
  port: 4466
  databases:
    default:
      connector: mongo
      uri: __YOUR_MONGO_DB_CONNECTION_STRING__
```

</Code>

## Managing database connections

The `connectionLimit` property in `PRISMA_CONFIG` determines the number of database connections a Prisma service is going to use.

<Warning>

The `connectionLimit` needs to be set to at least **2**. One connection is always reserved for the [Management API](foe1), all other connections are used for the Prisma service.

</Warning>

## Database schema

Prisma currently maintains a collection called `_RelayId`. This collection is there for historic reasons and will be removed [soon](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/4101).
