## Overview

Over the last months, we have worked with the community to define a new [datamodel specification](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/3408) for Prisma. This new version is called datamodel v1.1 and is currently available in an early preview. 

Please help us test the implementation of the new datamodel and share your feedback or report problems by [opening an issue in the feedback repo](https://github.com/prisma/datamodel-v1.1-feedback/issues/new). 

This document explains how to get started:

- [Prerequises & Installation](#prerequisites--installation)
- Option 1: [Get started from scratch](#get-started-from-scratch)
- Option 2: [Get started with an existing database](#get-started-with-an-existing-database)
- Option 3: [Upgrading from datamodel v1 to datamodel v1.1](#upgrading-to-datamodel-v11)

## Motivation

The main motivations for the new datamodel are:

- Enabling more control over how Prisma lays out the database schema
- Consolidated migrations (unifying the "active" and "passive" database connectors)

### More control over database layout

The current datamodel is opinionated about the database layout in many ways. Here are a few things that are now possible with datamodel v1.1:

- Model/field names in the datamodel can differ from the names of the underlying tables/columns
- Specify whether a relation should use a JOIN table or inline references
- Use any field as `id` field
- Use any field as `createdAt` or `updatedAt` fields

### Consolidated migrations

With the current datamodel, developers need to decide whether Prisma should perform database migrations for them, by setting the `migrations` flag in [`PRISMA_CONFIG`](https://www.prisma.io/docs/prisma-server/deployment-environments/docker-rty1/#prisma_config-reference) when the Prisma server is deployed. In datamodel v1.1 the `migrations` flag is removed, meaning developers can at all times either migrate the database manually or use Prisma for the migration.


## What's new in datamodel v1.1?

### Directives

#### `@db(name: String!)`

The `@db` directive is used to control how the datamodel is mapped to the underlying database schema. Specifically it allows developers to:

- Map the name of a Prisma model to a certain table in the underlying database
- Map the name of a field on a Prisma model to a certain column in the underlying database

##### Usage

The `@db` directive can be applied to:

- Types (i.e. models)
- Fields

Usage of the `@db` directive is **optional**. If it's not applied, the table/column name in the underlying database will default to name that's used in the Prisma datamodel.

##### Examples

_A model applying the directive on a type- and field-level. The underlying table will be called `user` and the column `full_name`_

```graphl
type User @db(name: "user") {
  id: ID! @id
  name: String! @db(name: "full_name")
}
```

_A model omitting the directive. The underlying table will be called `User`_

```graphl
type User {
  id: ID! @id
  name: String!
}
```

#### `@id`

The `@id` is used to indicate that a (scalar) field on a model is used as the primary identifier for that model. It implies that this field is _unique_.

##### Usage

The `@id` directive can be applied to scalar fields of types:

- `ID`
- `UUID`
- `Int`

It can be used at most once per model.

The `@id` directive takes one argument: `@id(strategy: Strategy!)` where `Strategy` is an enum with the following values:

- `AUTO` (default): Based on the type of the field an `id` will be generated automatically.
  - `Int`: An identity column is used to in the underlying database. For each database a matching implementation is selected, e.g. a column of type `SERIAL` for Postgres.
  - `UUID` and `ID`: Prisma will generate a random value for the type when a record is created.
- `NONE`: The `id` does not get auto-generated. The `id` field is then required whenever a record for that model is created.
- `SEQUENCE`: A sequence in the underlying database will be created to create IDs for records of this models. When this strategy is used the `@sequence` directive must be specified. This value can only be used if the field on which the `@id` directive is applied is of type `Int` (it doesn't work with `ID` or `UUID`).

##### Examples

_The `_myID` field is used as the primary identifier of the `User` model. IDs are auto-generated by Prisma (the `strategy` argument could also be omitted as it specifies the default value)_

```graphql
type User {
  myId: UUID! @id(strategy: AUTO)
  name: String!
}
```

_The `_myID` field is used as the primary identifier of the `User` model. IDs must be provided whenever a new record is created_

```graphql
type User {
  myId: ID! @id(strategy: NONE)
  name: String!
}
```

_The `_myID` field is used as the primary identifier of the `User` model. IDs are generated based on the `MY_SEQENCE` sequence in the database_

```graphql
type User {
  myID: Int! @id(strategy: SEQUENCE) @sequence(name: "MY_SEQUENCE" initialValue: 1 allocationSize: 100)
  name: String!
}
```

#### `@sequence`

The `@sequence` directive is used to specify how a primary identifier for a model is generated.

##### Usage

The `@sequence` directive can only be applied to fields of type `Int` that are annotated with the `@id(strategy: SEQUENCE)` directive. It takes three arguments:

1. `name: String!`: The name of the database sequence.
1. `initialValue: Int!`: The initial value for the database sequence.
1. `allocationSize: Int!`: The allocation size of the database sequence.

#### `@createdAt` & `@updatedAt`

The `@createdAt` and `@updatedAt` directives can be used to automatically track the times for when a record was _created_ and _last updated_. The fields annotated with either of those directives become _read-only_.

##### Usage

The `@createdAt` and `@updatedAt` directives can be applied to any fields of type `DateTime!`.

##### Examples

_The `myCreatedAt` and `myUpdatedAt` fields track the time when a `User` record was created and last updated_

```graphql
type User {
  id: ID! @id
  myCreatedAt: DateTime! @createdAt
  myUpdatedAt: DateTime! @updatedAt
}
```

#### `@relation`

See the the [Relations](#relations) section for more info.

#### `@linkTable`

See the the [Relations](#relations) section for more info.

### Relations

In Prisma, a relation connects two models. A direction can be uni- or bidirectional:

- Unidirectional: Only one model has a relation field to another model
- Bidirectional: Both models have relation fields to each other

A relation field is a field on a model that has another model as its type. For example, in the following datamodel `author` and `posts` are relation fields that mark a bidirectional relation (1:n) between the `User` and `Post` models:

```graphql
type User {
  id: ID! @id
  posts: [Post!]!
}

type Post {
  id: ID! @id
  author: User!
}
```

You can control how a relation is represented in the underlying database via the `@relation` and `@linkTable` directives. A relation can be represented in either of two ways:

- With a _relation table_: Prisma tracks the relation via a dedicated table that contains two columns which refer to the IDs of each model.
- As an _inline_ relation: Prisma tracks the relation via a foreign key in a column (not available for n:m relations)

> **Note:** The `@linkTable` directive will soon be updated to `@relationTable`. 

#### 1:1 relations

When defining a 1:1 relation between two models, you must add the `@relation` directive to one end of the relation. Otherwise Prisma doesn't know how it should lay out the relation in the underlying database.

##### Inline

```graphql
type User {
  id: ID! @id
  profile: Profile! @relation(link: INLINE)
}

type Profile {
  id: ID! @id
  user: User!
}
```

This stores the primary key of `Profile` in the `profile` column on the `User` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE "default$default"."User" (
    "id" varchar(25) NOT NULL,
    "profile" varchar(25),
    PRIMARY KEY ("id")
);
```

##### Relation table

###### Generatic relation table

```graphql
type User {
  id: ID! @id
  profile: Profile! @relation(link: TABLE)
}

type Profile {
  id: ID! @id
  user: User!
}
```

This creates the following relation table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE "default$default"."_PostToUser" (
  "A" varchar(25) NOT NULL,
  "B" varchar(25) NOT NULL
);
```

###### Relation table with a custom name (prepended with an underscore)

```graphql
type User {
  id: ID! @id
  profile: Profile! @relation(link: TABLE, name: "MyRelation")
}

type Profile {
  id: ID! @id
  user: User!
}
```

This creates the following relation table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE "default$default"."_MyRelation" (
  "A" varchar(25) NOT NULL,
  "B" varchar(25) NOT NULL
);
```

###### Customized relation table with `@linkTable`

```graphql
type User {
  id: ID! @id
  profile: Profile! @relation(link: TABLE, name: "MyRelation")
}

type Profile {
  id: ID! @id
  user: User!
}

type MyRelation @linkTable {
  user: User!
  profile: Profile!
}
```

This creates the following relation table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE "default$default"."MyRelation" (
  "profile" varchar(25) NOT NULL,
  "user" varchar(25) NOT NULL
);
```

The `@linkTable` directive should be used when you want to:

- remove the underscore in front of the relation name
- call the foreign key columns in the relation table something else than `A` and `B`

So you need it in the active case when you want to control that layout. More prominently you need it in the passive case, when you want to connect to an existing database that does not match the prisma conventions.

> **Note:** The `@linkTable` directive will soon be updated to `@relationTable`. 

#### 1:n relations

When defining a 1:n relation between two models, the `@relation` directive is optional. Prisma defaults to an inline relation.

##### Inline

```graphql
type User {
  id: ID! @id
  posts: [Post!]!
}

type Post {
  id: ID! @id
  author: User! @relation(link: INLINE)
}
```

This stores the primary key of `User` in the `author` column on the `Post` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE "relations$dev1"."Post" (
    "id" varchar(25) NOT NULL,
    "author" varchar(25),
    PRIMARY KEY ("id")
);
```

Note that in this case the `@relation` directive could also be omitted because this is the default behaviour for 1:n relations.

##### Relation table

###### Generatic relation table

```graphql
type User {
  id: ID! @id
  posts: [Post!]!
}

type Post {
  id: ID! @id
  author: User! @relation(link: TABLE)
}
```

This creates the following relation table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE "default$default"."_PostToUser" (
  "A" varchar(25) NOT NULL,
  "B" varchar(25) NOT NULL
);
```

###### Relation table with a custom name (prepended with an underscore)

```graphql
type User {
  id: ID! @id
  posts: [Post!]!
}

type Post {
  id: ID! @id
  user: User! @relation(link: TABLE, name: "MyRelation")
}
```

This creates the following relation table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE "default$default"."_MyRelation" (
  "A" varchar(25) NOT NULL,
  "B" varchar(25) NOT NULL
);
```

###### Customized relation table with `@linkTable`

```graphql
type User {
  id: ID! @id
  posts: [Post!]!
}

type Post {
  id: ID! @id
  user: User! @relation(link: TABLE, name: "MyRelation")
}

type MyRelation @linkTable {
  user: User!
  post: Post!
}
```

This creates the following relation table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE "default$default"."MyRelation" (
    "post" varchar(25) NOT NULL,
    "user" varchar(25) NOT NULL
);
```

> **Note:** The `@linkTable` directive will soon be updated to `@relationTable`. 

#### n:m relations

##### Inline relation

Not applicable

##### Relation table

###### Generatic relation table

```graphql
type Category {
  id: ID! @id
  posts: [Post!]!
}

type Post {
  id: ID! @id
  categories: [Category!]! @relation(link: TABLE)
}
```

This creates the following relation table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE "default$default"."_PostToCategory" (
  "A" varchar(25) NOT NULL,
  "B" varchar(25) NOT NULL
);
```

###### Relation table with a custom name (prepended with an underscore)

```graphql
type Category {
  id: ID! @id
  posts: [Post!]!
}

type Post {
  id: ID! @id
  categories: [Category!]! @relation(link: TABLE, name: "MyRelation")
}
```

This creates the following relation table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE "default$default"."_MyRelation" (
  "post" varchar(25) NOT NULL,
  "category" varchar(25) NOT NULL
);
```

###### Customized relation table with `@linkTable`

```graphql
type Category {
  id: ID! @id
  posts: [Post!]!
}

type Post {
  id: ID! @id
  categories: [Category!]! @relation(link: TABLE, name: "MyRelation")
}

type MyRelation @linkTable {
  user: User!
  post: Post!
}
```

This creates the following relation table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE "default$default"."MyRelation" (
    "post" varchar(25) NOT NULL,
    "cagtegory" varchar(25) NOT NULL
);
```

> **Note:** The `@linkTable` directive will soon be updated to `@relationTable`. 

## Migrations and introspection with the Prisma CLI

### `prisma deploy`

The command `prisma deploy` got enhanced. From now on, there will be two modes that allow developers to choose whether the Prisma migration system should migrate their database:

- `prisma deploy`: This command reads your datamodel and migrates the underlying database to match it.
- `prisma deploy --no-migrate`: This command does *not* migrate the underlying database. Instead, it expects the database schema to be in the right state already (which means you need to manually migrate the database _before_ running `prisma deploy --no-migrate`)! If the datamodel and database schema do not align, `prisma deploy` will throw an error.

### `prisma introspect`

The command `prisma introspect` has been adapted to output the new datamodel format when using it with the `--prototype` flag: 

```
prisma introspect --prototype
```

The command has been improved so that it will pay respect to existing datamodel files. This way you can use it to translate your database schema into a datamodel while the introspection will preserve the ordering of types and fields of your existing datamodel file.

### Common workflows

You can fluently switch between those two commands however you like. For instance you could use `prisma deploy` for most of your migration needs. When you hit an advanced use case where the Prisma migration system is not yet powerful enough, you can:

1. Migrate the database manually 
1. Use `prisma introspect --prototype` to update your datamodel with those changes from the database
1. Use `prisma deploy --no-migrate` to let the Prisma server know about that


## Prerequisites & Installation

The datamodel v1.1 is available in the [latest beta](b5op/) version of Prisma.

### 1. Install the latest beta of the Prisma CLI

```
npm install -g prisma@beta
```

### 2. Use the latest beta Prisma Docker image

In the Docker Compose file for your Prisma server, make sure to use the latest beta Docker image:

```yml
prismagraphql/prisma:1.30-beta
```

### 3. Set the `prototype` flag to `true` in `PRISMA_CONFIG`

Enable the datamodel v1.1 by adding the `prototype` flag in your [`PRISMA_CONFIG`](rty1/#prisma_config-reference):

```yml
port: 4466
prototype: true
databases:
  default:
    connector: postgres # or mysql
    host: 127.0.0.1
    port: 5432
    user: prisma
    password: prisma
```

> Note that you might need to adjust the database connection details to match your setup. Check out the [`example`](./example) folder for a ready-to-use setup.

## Get started from scratch

#### 1. Create Docker Compose file

Create a new file callled `docker-compose.yml` and add the following code to it:

```yml
version: '3'
services:
  prisma:
    image: prismagraphql/prisma:1.30-beta
    restart: always
    ports:
    - "4466:4466"
    environment:
      PRISMA_CONFIG: |
        port: 4466
        prototype: true
        databases:
          default:
            connector: postgres
            host: postgres
            user: prisma
            password: prisma
            port: 5432
  postgres:
    image: postgres
    restart: always
    ports:
    - "5432:5432"
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: prisma
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: prisma
    volumes:
      - postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data
volumes:
  postgres: ~
```

Note that in this example, we're using a PostgreSQL database. We're also exposing the PostgreSQL port `5432` so that you can e.g. connect to it from a database GUI like Postico.

### 2. Deploy Prisma server

Run the following command to deploy your server:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

### 3. Setup Prisma project

A Prisma project always requires at least two files: `prisma.yml` and a datamodel file (e.g. called `datamodel.prisma`).

Create the following `prisma.yml`:

```yml
endpoint: http://localhost:4466
datamodel: datamodel.prisma
```

And this `datamodel.prisma`:

```graphql
type User @db(name: "user") {
  id: ID! @id
  createdAt: DateTime! @createdAt
  email: String! @unique
  name: String
  role: Role @default(value: USER)
  posts: [Post!]!
  profile: Profile @relation(link: INLINE)
}

type Profile @db(name: "profile") {
  id: ID! @id
  user: User!
  bio: String!
}

type Post @db(name: "post") {
  id: ID! @id
  createdAt: DateTime! @createdAt
  updatedAt: DateTime! @updatedAt
  author: User!
  published: Boolean! @default(value: false)
  categories: [Category!]! @relation(link: TABLE, name: "PostToCategory")
}

type Category @db(name: "category") {
  id: ID! @id
  name: String!
  posts: [Post!]! @relation(name: "PostToCategory")
}

type PostToCategory @db(name: "post_to_category") @linkTable {
  post: Post
  category: Category
}

enum Role {
  USER
  ADMIN
}
```

Let's understand some important bits of the datamodel:

- Each model is mapped a table that's named after the model but lowercased using the `@db` directive
- There are the following relations:
  - **1:1** between `User` and `Profile`
  - **1:n** between `User` and `Post`
  - **n:m** between `Post` and `Category`
- The **1:1** relation between `User` and `Profile` is annotated with `@relation(link: INLINE)` on the `User` model. This means `user` records in the database have a reference to a `profile` record if the relation is present (because the `profile` field is not required, the relation might just be `NULL`). An alternative to `INLINE` is `TABLE` in which case Prisma would track the relation via a dedicated relation table.
- The **1:n** relation between `User` and `Post` is is tracked inline the relation via the `author` column of the `post` table, i.e. the `@relation(link: INLINE)` directive is inferred on the `author` field of the `Post` model.
- The **n:m** relation between `Post` and `Category` is tracked via a dedicated relation table called `PostToCategory`. This relation table is part of the datamodel and annotated with the `@linkTable` directive. (Note: The `@linkTable` directive will soon be updated to `@relationTable`.)
- Each model has an `id` field annotated with the `@id` directive.
- For the `User` model, the database automatically tracks _when_ a record is created via the field annotated with the `@createdAt` directive.
- For the `Post` model, the database automatically tracks _when_ a record is created and updated via the fields annotated with the `@createdAt` and `@updatedAt` directives.

### 4. Deploy datamodel (migrate database)

With `prisma.yml` and `datamodel.prisma` in place, you can deploy your datamodel:

```
prisma deploy
```

The underlying database that's created by Prisma is called after the service name and stage (separated by the `$` character). Because the `endpoint` in `prisma.yml` doesn't use these properties, Prisma defaults to `default` for both. The database name consequently is `default$default`.

Here is an overview of the tables that are being created in `default$default`:

##### `catgegory`

```sql
CREATE TABLE "default$default"."category" (
    "id" varchar(25) NOT NULL,
    "name" text NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY ("id")
);
```

| index_name | index_algorithm | is_unique | column_name |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `category_pkey` | `BTREE` | `TRUE` | `id` |


##### `post`

```sql
CREATE TABLE "default$default"."post" (
    "id" varchar(25) NOT NULL,
    "author" varchar(25),
    "published" bool NOT NULL,
    "createdAt" timestamp(3) NOT NULL,
    "updatedAt" timestamp(3) NOT NULL,
    "title" text NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY ("id")
);
```

| index_name | index_algorithm | is_unique | column_name |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `post_pkey` | `BTREE` | `TRUE` | `id` |

##### `post_to_category`

```sql
CREATE TABLE "default$default"."post_to_category" (
    "category" varchar(25) NOT NULL,
    "post" varchar(25) NOT NULL
);
```

| index_name | index_algorithm | is_unique | column_name |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `post_to_category_AB_unique` | `BTREE` | `TRUE` | `category`,`post`|
| `post_to_category_B` | `BTREE` | `FALSE` | `post`|

##### `profile`

```sql
CREATE TABLE "default$default"."profile" (
    "id" varchar(25) NOT NULL,
    "bio" text NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY ("id")
);
```

| index_name | index_algorithm | is_unique | column_name |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `profile_pkey` | `BTREE` | `TRUE` | `id` |

##### `user`

```sql
CREATE TABLE "default$default"."user" (
    "id" varchar(25) NOT NULL,
    "email" text NOT NULL,
    "name" text,
    "role" text NOT NULL,
    "createdAt" timestamp(3) NOT NULL,
    "profile" varchar(25),
    PRIMARY KEY ("id")
);
```

| index_name | index_algorithm | is_unique | column_name |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `user_pkey` | `BTREE` | `TRUE` | `id` |
| `default$default.user.email._UNIQUE` | `BTREE` | `TRUE` | `email` |


### 5. View and edit your data

From here on, you can use the [Prisma client](https://www.prisma.io/docs/prisma-client/) if you want to access the data in your database programmatically. In the following, we'll highlight two _visual_ ways to interact with the data.

#### Using Prisma Admin

To access your data in [Prisma Admin](https://www.prisma.io/docs/prisma-admin/), you need to navigate to the Admin endpoint of your Prisma project: `http://localhost:4466/_admin`

![](https://imgur.com/wJCyxVy.png)

#### Using TablePlus

While Prisma Admin is focussed on convenient data management workflows, you can also connect to your database from other database GUIs. In contrast to Admin, these tools typically highlight the actual database structure (instead of the Prisma datamodel abstraction). In this example, we're using [TablePlus](https://tableplus.io/). 

> To connect to your database from a database GUI, you need to [map the port](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#ports) in the database configuration of your Docker Compose file. In our case, this is why we're adding the `5432:5432` line to it.

When opening TablePlus, you need to:

1. Create a new connection
1. Select **PostgreSQL**
1. Provide a the database connection details:
    - **Name**: Can be anything, e.g. `Local PostgreSQL`
    - **Host/Socket**: `localhost`
    - **Port**: `5432`
    - **User**: `prisma`
    - **Password**: `prisma` 
    - **Database**: `prisma`
1. Click **Connect**

After you connected to the database, you can explore the data and table structure in the TablePlus GUI:

## Get started with an existing database

### 1. Introspect database & generate datamodel

If you have a database that already contains some data, you can get started by introspecting the database schema and let Prisma generate the right datamodel for you.

To get started, run:

```
prisma init --prototype
```

This launches an interactive wizard that guides you through the process of connecting to your existing database. The following interaction shows how to connect to a local PostgreSQL database:

```
$ prisma init myapp --prototype
? Set up a new Prisma server or deploy to an existing server? Use existing database
? What kind of database do you want to deploy to? PostgreSQL
? Does your database contain existing data? Yes
? Enter database host localhost
? Enter database port 5432
? Enter database user prisma
? Enter database password prisma
? Enter database name (the database includes the schema) myblog
? Use SSL? No
? Please select the schema you want to introspect public
Introspecting database public 113ms
Created datamodel definition based on 6 tables.
? Select the programming language for the generated Prisma client Don't generate

Created 3 new files:                                                                          

  prisma.yml           Prisma service definition
  datamodel.prisma    GraphQL SDL-based datamodel (foundation for database)
  docker-compose.yml   Docker configuration file

Next steps:

  1. Start your Prisma server: docker-compose up -d
  2. Deploy your Prisma service: prisma deploy
  3. Read more about introspection:
     http://bit.ly/prisma-introspection
```

Once the process has terminated, the Prisma CLI will have generated the following files inside the new `myapp` directory for you:

- `docker-compose.yml`: The Docker Compose file that specifies your Prisma server and its database connection.
- `prisma.yml`: The root configuration file for your Prisma project.
- `datamodel.prisma`: Your database schema represented in datamodel v1.1 syntax.

**IMPORTANT**: You need to manually [add the `prototype: true` flag](#3-set-the-prototype-flag-to-true-in-prisma_config) to `docker-compose.yml`:

```yml
port: 4466
prototype: true
databases:
  default:
    connector: postgres # or mysql
    host: 127.0.0.1
    port: 5432
    user: prisma
    password: prisma
```

### 2. Deploy Prisma setup

Now you can deploy your Prisma setup:

```
cd myapp
docker-compose up -d
prisma deploy

### 3. View and edit your data

From here on, you can use the [Prisma client](https://www.prisma.io/docs/prisma-client/) if you want to access the data in your database programmatically. 

To access your data in [Prisma Admin](https://www.prisma.io/docs/prisma-admin/), you need to navigate to the Admin endpoint of your Prisma project: `http://localhost:4466/_admin`

## Upgrading to datamodel v1.1

### 1. Datamodel v1 setup

Assume you have a deployed Prisma project with the following datamodel:

```graphql
type User {
  id: ID! @unique
  createdAt: DateTime!
  email: String! @unique
  name: String
  role: Role @default(value: "USER")
  posts: [Post!]!
  profile: Profile
}

type Profile {
  id: ID! @unique
  user: User!
  bio: String!
}

type Post {
  id: ID! @unique
  createdAt: DateTime!
  updatedAt: DateTime!
  title: String!
  published: Boolean! @default(value: "false")
  author: User!
  categories: [Category!]!
}

type Category {
  id: ID! @unique
  name: String!
  posts: [Post!]!
}

enum Role {
  USER
  ADMIN
}
```

When using the datamodel v1, the following tables are created by Prisma in the underlying database:

- `User`
- `Profile`
- `Post`
- `Category`
- `_CategoryToPost`
- `_PostToUser`
- `_ProfileToUser`
- `_RelayId`

Each relation is represented via a relation table and the `_RelayId` table to be able to identity any record by its ID. With the datamodel v1, these are Prisma opinionations that can not be worked around.

### 2. Enable datamodel v1.1

To enable the datamodel v1.1, you need to:

- Use the [latest beta](https://www.prisma.io/docs/releases-and-maintenance/releases-and-beta-access/installing-the-beta-b5op/) of Prisma (Prisma server _and_ CLI)
- Manually [add the `prototype: true` flag](#3-set-the-prototype-flag-to-true-in-prisma_config) to your Docker Compose file

For example, if you have are connecting to a local PostgreSQL database, your updated `docker-compose.yml` might look as follows:

```yml
version: '3'
services:
  prisma:
    image: prismagraphql/prisma:1.30-beta
    restart: always
    prototype: true
    ports:
    - "4466:4466"
    environment:
      PRISMA_CONFIG: |
        port: 4466
        databases:
          default:
            connector: postgres
            host: localhost
            user: prisma
            password: prisma
            port: '5432'    
```

Once you have specified the `prismagraphql/prisma:1.30-beta` image and introduced the `prototype: true` flag, you can redeploy your Prisma server:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

Now you can install the latest CLI beta, e.g. with npm:

```
npm install -g prisma@beta
```

At this point, you can already try to redeploy your Prisma datamodel. It won't work and the CLI will show some errors:

```
$ prisma deploy
Deploying service `default` to stage `default` to server `local` 585ms

Errors:

  User
    ✖ One field of the type `User` must be marked as the id field with the `@id` directive.
    ✖ The value "USER" is not a valid default for fields of type Enum.

  Profile
    ✖ One field of the type `Profile` must be marked as the id field with the `@id` directive.

  Post
    ✖ One field of the type `Post` must be marked as the id field with the `@id` directive.
    ✖ The value "false" is not a valid default for fields of type Boolean.

  Category
    ✖ One field of the type `Category` must be marked as the id field with the `@id` directive.

Deployment canceled. Please fix the above errors to continue deploying.

```

### 3. Migrating to datamodel v1.1 syntax

> **Note**: In this tutorial, we're updating the tutorial by hand. Alternatively, you can also generate a new datamodel using introspection: `prisma introspect --prototype`

To fix the errors that Prisma threw after `prisma deploy`, you need to:

- Use the `@id` directive instead of `@unique` on the `id` fields of your models
- Remove the quotes around the arguments of the `@default` directives
- Specify a relation type (_inline_ or _relation table_) on the 1:1 relation between `User` and `Profile` (i.e. add the `@relation` directive with the `link` argument to one end of the relation)

Here is the datamodel updated to the new syntax:

```graphql
type User {
  id: ID! @id
  createdAt: DateTime! @createdAt
  email: String! @unique
  name: String
  role: Role @default(value: USER)
  posts: [Post!]!
  profile: Profile @relation(link: TABLE)
}

type Profile {
  id: ID! @id
  user: User!
  bio: String!
}

type Post {
  id: ID! @id
  createdAt: DateTime! @createdAt
  updatedAt: DateTime! @updatedAt
  title: String!
  published: Boolean! @default(value: false)
  author: User!
  categories: [Category!]!
}

type Category {
  id: ID! @id
  name: String!
  posts: [Post!]!
}

enum Role {
  USER
  ADMIN
}
```

Now you can deploy the datamodel with the new syntax:

```
prisma deploy
```

### 4. Optimizing the database schema

When updating the datamodel syntax to v1.1, the existing database schema will remain the same, therefore keeping the opinionations of the datamodel v1. For example, you can't turn a relation that was represented via a relation table in v1 into an inline relation using the Prisma migration system. 

If you want to optimize your database schema and take advantage of the new features, there are two options:

- Option 1: Export the data from the old project and import it into a new Prisma project where the optimisations are applied
- Option 2: Manually migrate the database schema and subsequently adjust the datamodel to match it

###### 4.1. Export data 

To export the data, you can run the following command (inside the directory where your `prisma.yml` is located):

```
prisma export
```

This creates the following file: `export-TIMESTAMP.zip`, where `TIMESTAMPT` represents the time of the export, e.g. `export-2019-03-21T09:08:48.816Z.zip`.

###### 4.2. Optimize the database schema

Next, you need to initialize a new Prisma project that has a similar configuration as your previous one, e.g. the following `prisma.yml`:

```yml
endpoint: http://localhost:4466
datamodel: datamodel.prisma
```

When creating the new datamodel file, you can copy over your current datamodel and apply the optimizations you want to introduce. In this case, we will:

- Turn the 1:1 relation between `User` and `Profile` into an _inline_ relation tracked via the `User` table
- Turn the one-to-manby relation between `User` and `Post` into an _inline_ relation tracked via the `Post` table

Here's the datamodel that incorporates these changes, put it into a file called `datamodel.prisma`:

```graphql
type User {
  id: ID! @id
  createdAt: DateTime! @createdAt
  email: String! @unique
  name: String
  role: Role @default(value: USER)
  posts: [Post!]!
  profile: Profile @relation(link: INLINE)
}

type Profile {
  id: ID! @id
  user: User!
  bio: String!
}

type Post {
  id: ID! @id
  createdAt: DateTime! @createdAt
  updatedAt: DateTime! @updatedAt
  title: String!
  author: User!
  published: Boolean! @default(value: false)
  categories: [Category!]!
}

type Category {
  id: ID! @id
  name: String!
  posts: [Post!]!
}

enum Role {
  USER
  ADMIN
}
```

> Note that `@relation(link: INLINE)` on `author` could also be omitted since `INLINE` is the default relation type for a 1:n relation.

With these changes in place, you can deploy the datamodel: 

```
prisma deploy
```

The new database schema now has the following (empty) tables:

- `User`
- `Profile`
- `Post`
- `Category`
- `_CategoryToPost`

###### 4.3. Import the data

To import the data, you need to use the `prisma import` command and point it to the exported file from [4.1.](#41-export-data), e.g.:

```
prisma import -d ./export-2019-03-21T09:08:48.816Z.zip
```

Note that there currently still is a [bug](https://github.com/prisma/datamodel-v1.1-feedback/issues/1) that prevents this from working smoothly. One workaround is to just add the `createdAt: DateTime! @createdAt` and `updatedAt: DateTime! @updatedAt` fields to thyour new datamodel. 

## FAQ

#### Where should I report bugs?

Please report bugs directly [here](https://github.com/prisma/datamodel-v1.1-for-sql-beta/issues) in this repo!

#### What is not part of this beta?

1. [Multi column indexes](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/3405) are not of this beta yet. We are currently working on implementing them.
2. [Polymorphic relations](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/3407) are not part of this beta. We will make a separate effort to implement them.


#### How can I migrate my Prisma project with existing data to a new optimised database schema (e.g. JOIN tables have been removed)? 

We recommend the following:

1. Use `prisma export` to export the data from your existing Prisma project.
1. Copy your existing datamodel to a new Prisma project and apply your desired optimisations to your datamodel.
1. Use `prisma import` to import the data into your new Prisma project.
