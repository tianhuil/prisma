## Overview

A database connector is the bridge between Prisma and the underlying database. The PostgreSQL connector is used to connect a Prisma server to a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database. 

The core responsibilities of a database connector are:

- Translate Prisma client requests into SQL
- Send the generated SQL query to the database
- Return the database results as back to the Prisma client
- Perform database migrations (optional)

When configuring your Prisma server with Docker, you need to specify which connector you'd like to use in order to connect to a certain database. You provide this info via the `connector` property:

<Code lines="6">

```yml
PRISMA_CONFIG: |
  managementApiSecret: __YOUR_MANAGEMENT_API_SECRET__
  port: 4466
  databases:
    default:
      connector: postgres
      host: __YOUR_DATABASE_HOST__
      port: __YOUR_DATABASE_PORT__
      user: __YOUR_DATABASE_USER__
      password: __YOUR_DATABASE_PASSWORD__
      connectionLimit: __YOUR_CONNECTION_LIMIT__
```

</Code>

## Managing database connections

The `connectionLimit` property in `PRISMA_CONFIG` determines the number of database connections a Prisma service is going to use.

<Warning>

The `connectionLimit` needs to be set to at least **2**. One connection is always reserved for the [Management API](foe1), all other connections are used for the Prisma service.

</Warning>

## Database schema

Prisma currently maintains a table called `_RelayId`. This table is there for historic reasons and will be removed [soon](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/4101).
