## Overview

The `Prisma` constructor is used to create new instances of the Prisma client.

```js
constructor(options: BaseClientOptions)
```

`BaseClientOptions` has the following properties (all are optional):

- `endpoint: string`: The endpoint of your Prisma service. If not provided, the client will default to the `endpoint` that was specified in `prisma.yml` when the client was generated. 
- `secret: string`: The [secret](5cy7#secret-optional) protecting the API of your Prisma service. If not provided, the client will default to the `secret` that was specified in `prisma.yml` when the client was generated. 
- `debug: boolean`: If set to `true`, each invokation of a method on the Prisma client will print the GraphQL query that is sent to the Prisma API to the console. **Default: `false`**.

### Examples

_Use default values for `endpoint` and `secret` that were specified in `prisma.yml` when the client was generated_:

```js
const prisma = new Prisma({})
```

_Override default values for `endpoint` and `secret` that had been specified in `prisma.yml` when the client was generated_:

```js
const prisma = new Prisma({ 
  endpoint: "http://localhost:4466/hello-world/dev",
  secret: "mysecret42",
})
```
