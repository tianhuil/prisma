## `prisma generate`

Invokes the _generators_ specified in `prisma.yml`. Available generators are:

The following generators are built-into the Prisma CLI:

- Prisma client in JavaScript: `javascript-client`
- Prisma client in TypeScript: `typescript-client`
- Prisma client in Flow: `flow-client`
- Prisma client in Go: `go-client`
- GraphQL schema of the Prisma API: `graphql-schema`

By default, the Prisma client is generated locally based on the [datamodel](knul). If the datamodel is currently out-of-sync with the API of the running Prisma service, it's also possible to generate the client from the live API instead of the datamodel using the `--endpoint` option. `prisma generate` looks up the `endpoint` in your `prisma.yml` when the option is added to the command. If you want to provide a custom endpoint, you can add it as an argument to the `--endpoint` option as well.

### Usage

```bash
prisma generate [flags]
```

### Flags

```
-e, --env-file ENV-FILE    Path to .env file to inject env vars
-p, --project PROJECT    Path to Prisma definition file
--endpoint    Use a specific endpoint for schema generation or pick endpoint from prisma.yml
```

### Examples

**Generate the TypeScript client and store the generated files at `./generated/prisma`**

`prisma.yml`:

```yml
generate:
    - generator: typescript-client
      output: ./generated/prisma
```

```bash
prisma generate
```

**Generate the TypeScript client from custom endpoint**

`prisma.yml`:

```yml
generate:
    - generator: typescript-client
      output: ./generated/prisma
```

```bash
prisma generate --endpoint http://localhost:4466
```

**Generate the Go client and the GraphQL schema store the generated files at `./generated/prisma`**

`prisma.yml`:

```yml
generate:
    - generator: go-client
      output: ./generated/prisma
    - generator: graphql-schema
      output: ./generated/prisma
```

```bash
prisma generate
```
