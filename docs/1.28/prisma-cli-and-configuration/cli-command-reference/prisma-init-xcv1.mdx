## `$ prisma init`

Bootstraps the service configuration for a new Prisma service. The command launches an interactive CLI wizard by default, helping you to decide where (i.e. to which Prisma server) the service should be deployed later.

If you already know the endpoint, you can pass it using the `--endpoint` flag and skip the interactive wizard.

The generated files are:

- `prisma.yml`
- `datamodel.prisma`
- `docker-compose.yml` (optional)

If you provide a directory name as an argument to the command, the generated files will be placed inside a new directory with that name.


### Flags

```bash
-e, --endpoint         The endpoint to be written into prisma.yml
```

### Usage

```bash
prisma init DIRNAME
```

### Examples

**Create service configuration for Prisma service in a directory called `myapp` using the wizard**

```bash
prisma init myapp
```

**Skip wizard and create service configuration for Prisma service in a directory called `myapp`**

```bash
prisma init myapp --endpoint http://localhost:4466/myapp/dev
```
