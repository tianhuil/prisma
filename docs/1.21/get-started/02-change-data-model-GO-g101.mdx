## Goals

On this page, you will learn how to:

- Adjust the datamodel and update your Prisma API
- Regenerate your Prisma client
- Create two database records in a single transaction
- Query relational data

<Warning>

This page is only relevant if you started with a [new database](t002) or a [demo server](t001). If you configured Prisma with an [existing database](t003), you need to run migrations directly against your database.

</Warning>

## Adjust your datamodel

Update the datamodel in `datamodel.prisma` as follows:

```graphql copy
type User {
  id: ID! @unique
  email: String @unique
  name: String!
  posts: [Post!]!
}

type Post {
  id: ID! @unique
  title: String!
  published: Boolean! @default(value: "false")
  author: User
}
```

Here's what changed:

- You added a new `email` field to the `User` type.
- You added a new `Post` type to the datamodel.
- You added a _relation_ between `User` and `Post` (via the `posts` and `author` fields).


## Redeploy your Prisma API

To apply the changes you just made to your datamodel, you need to redeploy the Prisma API:

```bash copy
prisma deploy
```

## Regenerate your Prisma client

Because the Prisma client is based on your datamodel, it needs to be regenerated every time the datamodel is updated:

```bash copy
prisma generate
```

The Prisma client library in the `/generated/prisma-client` directory is now being updated and its API has been adjusted to use the new datamodel.

## Read and write nested objects

The Prisma client API allows to write nested objects in a single transaction without having to manually control when the transaction starts or ends.

Update your `index.go` to look as follows:

```go copy
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	prisma "hello-prisma/generated/prisma-client"
)

func main() {
	client := prisma.New(nil)
	ctx := context.TODO()

	// Create a new user with two posts
	name := "Alice"
	email := "alice@prisma.io"
	title1 := "Join us for GraphQL Conf in 2018"
	title2 := "Subscribe to GraphQL Weekly for GraphQL news"
	newUser, err := client.CreateUser(prisma.UserCreateInput{
		Name:  name,
		Email: &email,
		Posts: &prisma.PostCreateManyWithoutAuthorInput{
			Create: []prisma.PostCreateWithoutAuthorInput{
				prisma.PostCreateWithoutAuthorInput{
					Title: title1,
				},
				prisma.PostCreateWithoutAuthorInput{
					Title: title2,
				},
			},
		},
	}).Exec(ctx)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	fmt.Printf("Created new user: %+v\\n", newUser)

	allUsers, err := client.Users(nil).Exec(ctx)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	fmt.Printf("%+v\\n", allUsers)

	allPosts, err := client.Posts(nil).Exec(ctx)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	fmt.Printf("%+v\\n", allPosts)
}
```

Run the script with the following command:

```bash copy
go run index.go
```

## Query relational data

With the Prisma client API, you can navigate relations in your data graph using chained method calls (also called _fluent API_). Here is how you can query the `posts` written by a certain `User`:

```js copy
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	prisma "hello-prisma/generated/prisma-client"
)

func main() {
	client := prisma.New(nil)
	ctx := context.TODO()

	email := "alice@prisma.io"
	postsByUser, err := client.User(prisma.UserWhereUniqueInput{
		Email: &email,
	}).Posts(nil).Exec(ctx)

	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	fmt.Printf("%+v\\n", postsByUser)
}
```
