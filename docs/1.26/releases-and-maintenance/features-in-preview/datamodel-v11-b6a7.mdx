## Overview

We are currently working on a [new version of the Prisma datamodel](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/3408) with many great improvements.

The syntax of the new datamodel is currently in [Preview](oje2#preview-vs-final) and can be used with the [MongoDB connector](b6o5). Other datamodel features, such as indexes and polymorphic relations, are not yet available.

Note that this version of the datamodel was initially introduced as **Datamodel v2** but now is being referred to as **Datamodel v1.1**.
