## Overview

There are two ways to migrate your database with Prisma:

- Using the Prisma CLI
- Performing a manual DB migration with plain SQL

## Migrations with the Prisma CLI

When using Prisma with a MySQL database, you can perform your database migrations using the [`prisma deploy`](xcv9) command of the Prisma CLI.

There are two steps to every database migration:

1. Adjust the [datamodel](knul) file to reflect the new desired schema
1. Run `prisma deploy` to apply the changes and perform the migration of the underlying database

## Manual migrations with SQL

When migrating your database manually, you need to ensure that the Prisma datamodel matches the database schema after the migration. The easiest way to do so is by using the `prisma introspect` command to generate a datamodel file based on your migrated database schema and then use this new datamodel file as the new foundation for your Prisma project.
